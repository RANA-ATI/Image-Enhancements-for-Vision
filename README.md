## Project: Image Processing Techniques Implementation

### Overview

This repository showcases the implementation of various image processing techniques on custom images. These techniques have been applied to enhance image quality, extract features, and improve the overall visual appeal of images.

### Some of the Implemented Techniques

- Image Negative
  Inverts pixel intensities to enhance visibility and reveal hidden details.
- Image Smoothing using Histogram Equalization
  Improves contrast and visibility by redistributing pixel intensities across the entire histogram.

- Edge Detection
  Identifies boundaries within an image, aiding in feature extraction and object identification.

- Canny Filter
  A precise edge detection algorithm that reduces noise and provides a cleaner edge map.
- Sepia Filter
  Adds a warm, brownish tone to images, creating a nostalgic or artistic effect.
- Otsu Threshold Segmentation
  Automatically determines an optimal threshold for image segmentation, separating regions with different characteristics.

- K-Means Segmentation
  Groups pixels into clusters based on similarity, allowing the separation of different objects or regions in an image.
- Contour Detection
  Identifies the boundaries of objects in an image, useful for object recognition and tracking.
